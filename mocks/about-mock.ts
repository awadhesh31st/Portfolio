  description: `<p> I am an experienced <span className="text-pink font-light sm:font-regular px-[3.5px]"> front-end developer </span> with a passion for Javascript and a strong expertise in ReactJS. I have a great depth of knowledge in developing performant, decoupled, testable and maintainable code that is easy to work with. I enjoy working collaboratively with my teammates, sharing my knowledge and skills, and learning new technologies in the process. </p> <p> As a developer, I take a keen <span className="text-yellow font-extraLight sm:font-regular px-[3.5px]"> interest in open-source </span> and leverage existing libraries whenever it makes sense. I have the ability to <span className="text-pink font-extraLight sm:font-regular px-[3.5px]"> write components in vanilla JavaScript </span> but can also work with existing libraries when needed. I am highly familiar with <span className="text-yellow font-extraLight sm:font-regular px-[3.5px]"> React and Redux and write </span> all new code with ES6 features. </p> <p> I have a thirst for knowledge and always <span className="text-yellow font-extraLight sm:font-regular px-[3.5px]"> seek to learn new programming languages, frameworks, and paradigms </span> . My expertise in front-end development combined with my curiosity and ability to learn quickly makes me an ideal candidate for any challenging project. </p> <p> My passion for <span className="text-pink font-extraLight sm:font-regular px-[3.5px]"> creating intuitive and user-friendly web interfaces </span> is what drives me to constantly improve and challenge myself. I believe in the power of design and user experience to drive success and satisfaction for both businesses and their customers. </p>`,
